# A Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

An application I built in order to learn these algorithms more in depth, and also to strengthen my Javascript, HTML, and CSS! Enjoy watching the sorting in action: https://peterfink89.github.io/SortingVisualizer/

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
